```

This repository is a complete, replayable demo of
[**Telos**](https://github.com/hugues31/telos-sdd) — a local CLI for
spec-driven development where the source of truth is not the code but a
typed, queryable, hash-sealed base of *intents*.

Momo's soul lives in [`telos/`](telos/): 2 bounded contexts, 3 capabilities,
10 notions, 12 intents in EARS form, 17 scenarios each proven by a sealed
red-then-green test witness, and 2 constraints with executable checks. The Python in
[`tamagotchi/`](tamagotchi/) is just *one possible solution* of that
spec — Telos happens to be written in Rust, and does not care.

## Meet the pet

```console
# 1. Telos — a single binary, checksum-verified; only git is needed at runtime
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hugues31/telos-sdd/main/install.sh | TELOS_VERSION=v0.11.0 sh
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"

# 2. pytest (Telos invokes it to seal test verdicts)
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install pytest
export PATH="$PWD/.venv/bin:$PATH"

# 3. Look around, then play
telos status --json
python3 -m tamagotchi --ascii-art
```

Feed Momo, or don't — starvation is a sealed intent too (INT-0008,
"Starvation is not a lifestyle").

## The story, in six versions

Each version is one Telos change: opened, staged, reviewed, approved
against its digest, implemented test-first with sealed witnesses, and
reconciled through the eleven gates. Each is a git tag you can check
out.

| Tag | Prompt | What Momo learns | What Telos shows |
|---|---|---|---|
| `v0.0.0` | [00-bootstrap](prompts/00-bootstrap.md) | to not exist yet | `init`, the seal, agent skills, CI gate |
| `v0.1.0` | [01-hatch-and-feed](prompts/01-hatch-and-feed.md) | hatching, eating | notions, EARS intents, JSON payloads, red→green witnesses, `bind`, `reconcile` |
| `v0.2.0` | [02-play-and-mood](prompts/02-play-and-mood.md) | joy, appetite, weight | wholesale `edit`, decimal typing, growing an intent without re-witnessing it |
| `v0.3.0` | [03-time-and-sleep](prompts/03-time-and-sleep.md) | time, fatigue, sleep | `state-driven` and `unwanted` templates, `requires` |
| `v0.4.0` | [04-neglect-and-death](prompts/04-neglect-and-death.md) | mortality | `ubiquitous` template, a constraint with an executable fuzzer check |
| `v0.5.0` | [05-evolution-and-cli](prompts/05-evolution-and-cli.md) | growing up, being seen | `optional` template, `refines`, `in` expressions, **a reconcile refused by `TELOS_CONSTRAINT_FAILED`** — then fixed |
| — | [06-the-drift-incident](prompts/06-the-drift-incident.md) | (nothing; it never happened) | drift detection, the frozen workflow, `revert --expected-state` |
| — | [07-your-turn](prompts/07-your-turn.md) | that death should mean something | the hole in the spec is yours to seal |

## Replay it yourself

Three ways, same story:

- **Read** the prompts in order — every command and payload is on the
  page, prose first, exact script after.
- **Hand the mission statements to a coding agent.** `telos init
  --agents claude` already installed the skills in
  [`.claude/skills/`](.claude/skills/): the agent routes on `telos
  status --json`, challenges the spec, implements red-to-green, and is
  physically unable to approve its own change without the digest you
  read. (Install `telos` before opening an agent here — a guard hook is
  configured.)
- **Run the deterministic driver** — it parses the machine-readable
  blocks out of the prompt files and executes them in a blank
  directory:

  ```console
  python3 tools/replay.py --target /tmp/momo --compare
  ```

  The replay and checked-in model both use Telos 0.11.0. The final comparison
  proves the reconstructed files match this repository byte-for-byte.

## This demo is also an end-to-end test

CI replays the complete story from an empty directory on every push
with the same Telos 0.11.0 toolchain
([demo.yml](.github/workflows/demo.yml)), proving in one run: `init`,
config staging, five change transactions, 21 sealed witnesses, two
executable constraint checks, one deliberate constraint failure, drift
detection and revert — through the public CLI only. A second workflow
([telos.yml](.github/workflows/telos.yml)) gates the current Telos 0.11 model
on every push with `telos check --sealed`. The `pages` job publishes
`telos view --export` — browse

## Repository map

```
telos/            the sealed spec — contexts, capabilities, notions, intents, constraints, bindings, lock
prompts/          the story: 8 prompts, prose + exact replay script
tamagotchi/       one Python solution of the spec (domain, renderer, CLI)
tests/            17 scenario proofs, discovered by the scn_NNNN convention
tools/replay.py   deterministic replay driver (stdlib only)
tools/record_demo.py  records docs/demo.gif from the exported spec site
tools/check_*.py  the constraints' executable checks (fuzzer, AST import guard)
```

## Sharp edges worth knowing

- `telos/` is sealed: edit it by hand and every workflow command
  refuses to run until you `adopt` or `revert`
  ([prompt 06](prompts/06-the-drift-incident.md) does it on purpose).
- The runner is `pytest -q -k '{filter}'` and Telos substitutes the
  discovered test's name. The quoted placeholder also keeps full-suite
  reconciliation valid by passing an empty expression to `-k`.
- Scenario ids are allocated in staging order. Replay from scratch and
  you get the same ids; stage in another order and yours will differ —
  read ids from the CLI's JSON, never assume.
